**ConstraintEqualToConstant(c as Double) As SOSLayoutConstraint**
Returns a constraint equal to a specified constant

**ConstraintGreaterThanOrEqualToAnchor(anchor as SOSLayoutDimension, multiplier as Double = 1.0, offset as Double = 0.0) As SOSLayoutConstraint**
Creates a new constraint greater or equal to the current layout dimension and another, using a multiplier and an offset.

**ConstraintGreaterThanOrEqualToConstant(c as Double) As SOSLayoutConstraint**
Creates a constraint greater than or equal to a constant value

**ConstraintLessThanOrEqualToAnchor(anchor as SOSLayoutDimension, multiplier as Double = 1.0, offset as Double = 0.0) As SOSLayoutConstraint**
Creates a new constraint less or equal to the current layout dimension and another, using a multiplier and an offset.

**ConstraintLessThanOrEqualToConstant(c as Double) As SOSLayoutConstraint**
